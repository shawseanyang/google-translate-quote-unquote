Google ***\"Translate\"***
=======

Takes your perfectly good input and spices it up using multiple random layers of Google Translate!

Provide an `INPUT` in `translate.py`, the number of languages (`LAYERS`) to subject it to, and then feast your eyes!

Its wondrous what Google Translate can come up with:

`'Art doesnt have to be intentional.'`
<br>
--> <img width=300 src="examples/example-art.png"></img>

You won't ever need another inspirational quote generator.


`'One small action would change her life, but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be determined.`
<br>
--> <img width=800 src="examples/example-one.png"></img>


Sometimes, the meaning is retained, and is even distilled:

`'Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.'`
<br>
--> <img width=275 src="examples/example-each.png"></img>

Let's get mythical:

`'Today I dressed my unicorn up in preparation for the race.'`
<br>
--> <img width=450 src="examples/example-unicorn1.png"></img>

Often, the same input will yield many different results each time you run, because the languages chosen are randomized!

`'Today I dressed my unicorn up in preparation for the race.'`
<br>
--> <img width=400 src="examples/example-unicorn2.png"></img>

Google Translate can also give you opinions on slogans:

`'People. Technology. Awesome'`
<br>
--> <img width=400 src="examples/example-slogan.png"></img>
